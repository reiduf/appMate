When a posted application is clicked, a page showing the application status, salary, location, application date appears. There is also a section to post notes about the job, a section to update the status of the application/interview proccess and a todo list where you can create custom to-do's to keep you on top of and prepared for what the job/interview will entail.

This is the AppMate form page where you can create, edit or delete certain criteria for the job like position, company, salary, location, applied date and more. We have also added a feature where you can "bookmark" a certain position so that it stays highlighted in the home page to keep you reminded.

This is the user dash board! The main features here highlight applications that are "going cold" and need to be followed up with. The Dash also highlights the pending To-Do's.

This is the connections index page, listing the connections made and displaying their name, company, and where they were connected(in person, online, at an event).

The connections detail page goes more in depth providing contact details and listed interactions with dates and jobs they are connected to. You can add and delete notes and interactions.
